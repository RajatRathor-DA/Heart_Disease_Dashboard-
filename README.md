## 🗄️ Data Source  
Dataset: **Heart Disease Clinical Dataset**  
Contains patient details such as **age, gender, survival status, serum sodium levels, cancer, diabetes, and high blood pressure conditions**.  

---

# 🚀 Features & Highlights  

### 🛠️ Business Problem  
Heart disease is influenced by multiple factors like **age, comorbidities, and serum levels**. Without proper analytics, it’s difficult for medical professionals to track survival patterns and predict risks.  

### 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard  
To provide a **clear, interactive tool** for analyzing patient survival rates, mortality causes, and comorbidity impacts, enabling **data-driven healthcare strategies**.  

---

## 🔎 Key Analysis Walkthrough  
- **KPIs**: Average Alive Age → 58.76 | Total Alive → 203 | Alive % → 67.89% | Total Deaths → 96  
- **By Cancer**: 63 alive patients, 28 with cancer  
- **By High Blood Pressure**: 63 alive, 32 with HBP  
- **By Diabetes**: 63 alive, 40 with diabetes  
- **Serum Sodium**: Avg. levels ~136–137, with higher death correlation in patients aged 71+ (0.60 death rate)  
- **Age Groups**: Most survivors in the **51–70 range**  
- **Gender Split**: Interactive filter for Male vs Female comparisons
